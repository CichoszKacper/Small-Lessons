/* We'll say that a number is "teen" if it is in the range 13 -19 (inclusive).

Write a method hasTeen with 3 parameters of type int.

The method should return boolean and it needs
to return true if one of parameters is in range 13(inclusive) - 19 (inclusive). Otherwise return false.

EXAMPLES OF INPUT/OUTPUT:

hasTeen(9, 99, 19);  should return true since 19 is in range 13 - 19
hasTeen(23, 15, 42);  should return true since 15 is in range 13 - 19
hasTeen(22, 23, 34);  should return false since numbers 22, 23, 34 are not in range 13-19
NOTE: The hasTeen method  needs to be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
NOTE: Do not add a  main method to solution code. */
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(hasTeen(20,8,22));
    }
    public static boolean hasTeen(int firstNumber, int secondNumber, int thirdNumber){
        if ((firstNumber>=13 && firstNumber<=19) || (secondNumber>=13 && secondNumber<=19) || (thirdNumber>=13 && thirdNumber<=19)){
            return true;
        }else {
            return false;
        }
    }
